###Gwen Bell, I Hate You: The End of Personal Narrative

**If you have any notions of me or yourself you cherish, do not read any further. Click away now.**

The era of personal narrative _is over_. 

If you want to make it on the web, you have to boost your technical skills. That's the only thing left that people will pay you for. And even that, India's watching. (Note, I don't begrudge India that. Mofos know how to hustle.)

Nobody wants to pay you for personal narrative anymore; people believe they're _entitled_ to it.

<hr />

In 2008 or thereabouts I found myself at a tech event. Soft tech. Blogging. I was at this shindig in the backyard of an 'industry' guy who has since done some of the shadiest shit known to man - which is ok, [BJ Mendelson](http://bjmendelson.com/) is _on_ his ass. 

At the event, I was wearing cherry red four-inch platform shoes.

Anyway, this woman clumps up to me with her thousdand dollar camera and says, Gwen Bell. I'll just say it since nobody else will. I hate you. I hate your long long beautiful legs and I was tempted to trip you, just to spite you. Just to **stop your strut**. 

Then she laughed loud and full all, _just kiddin' girlfriend_. 

I shrugged it off but did not forget.

At least she was honest and direct. She was telling the truth. People have been jealous of what I get up to since I was old enough to understand what jealousy was, so probably elementary school. Usually I shrugged it off, and for a time, I rolled that energy into my work and just kept telling stronger, better stories.

That stopped yesterday. 

**Yesterday, I ended the contract with my literary agent.** I called it off, she was gracious about it, and I am grateful for that. 

The book I thought I'd publish was personal narrative. Memoir. To this day, people email asking for it. Gwen Bell. Write your memories. You have _such_ a _fascinating_ life _story_. Recently I've taken to interpreting that as _Gwen Bell. I hate you. Why do you have to have such a great life?_

Since I got divorced, the jealousy around my personal life appears to have increased. You'd think it'd decrease, right? It hasn't. Why? **People want divorces like a fat kid wants another donut.** 

People, including people like you reading these words right now, are afraid to get a divorce. And I had the balls and chutzpah to do it. I got one. 

That adds a whole new level to the jealousy. People not knowing why they're jealous of my misfortune. Yet they are. They see me hitting my stride in 2013, and they're all, shit. How's she doing this _after_ a divorce. She should be staring at the bottom of another ice cream vat.

They see the divorce as unfortunate. I see it as I don't even have a word for it, so I'll use a phrase. I'm free, bitches!

Haha. 

And if you were thinking a man will bail you out, you're wrong. Wrong, wrong riggity wrong. Don't be that kind of wrong. 

I proved that. All of it, by the time I turned thirty. A man is not going to bail you out, yo. You are. Only you. Occasionally a kind soul or twelve will throw you a [gittip](http://gittip.com/gwenbell), but no Man Plan is gonna cut it.

And still. After all that. I am still in possession of the long legs, the great figure, the beautiful apartment in Brooklyn, the daily donut habit, the tremendous yoga practice, the grandparents who love me and the guy match with whom I spend a lot of my time. 

So. Why am I telling you this?

Because I'm telling it for the last time.

Today I deleted all but the two pertinent paragraphs from my about page. 

You don't _care_ about my about page. Nor do I care about yours. 

YOU care about your about page. 

YOU care about your Twitter feed. 

YOU care who retweets you. 

I do not.

In 2011 during a speaking engagement I told a roomful of women bloggers that I don't use RSS because I don't read anybody's blog. Time stopped. There was a collective gasp. Like how _dare_ I say that. They thought of themselves as peers. I thought of them as potential customers.

I'm usually two years ahead of things on the tech front, so now it's two years later. Whose blog do you read? Whose site do you contribute to or care about, other than your own?

On a recent call a reader (I'll venture _former reader_ after this) asked why I don't subscribe to her updates. On the spot, I came clean. What I've seen of your life, I said...well, I already know too much. Why would I subscribe to more drama?

I don't do drama. 

_That_ is why I don't have a F-book account. That and I think it's a terrible color blue.

I haven't clicked back to her site since. She was right to put me on the spot. Not even a little drama? _Not even a little_. It's _shenpa_. It's the itch you shouldn't scratch. The scab you shouldn't pick.

Also like the blogging women of 2011, she's a potential client, not a peer. You want to be a peer, up your [technical skills game](http://git.gwenbell.com).

So. Here's what I'm gonna do. Right now. I'll tell you one last final personal narrative. It's also the secret to all I've done to date and will do in the future and if you have any reason to be jealous of me, it's this.

**How to Ditch the Story and Upgrade Your Game**

Hi. I'm Gwen Bell. I'm a developer. I'm obsessed with Git. 

And you. Let's talk about you. 

There are two groups of people who subscribe to my work. 

On one side of the room, I have the ladies. You email me telling me you don't want to learn technical skills. You wish you had the energy, time, the Presence, to sit down and learn something hard. You say you can't be fucked. 

Why? You say it's because you care more about my personal life than my professional abilities. You want to hear more stories, more creative writing, more memoir. That's a lie.

Really, women, isn't what you want more _drama_? Isn't what you want is one more distraction so you don't have to look at yourself and your life?

On the other side of the room there are the people who support my work. I hate to say it. No, really I do hate to say it, because I want it to be false, but those of you who support my work are almost exclusively men. Men with technical skills. Men who live in on the West or East coast in an above average city. Men from Germany and London, New York and SF. Men who usually have excellent senses of style and humor. (Thank you, guys.)

I'll throw a few of you ladies in this camp. Most of you in this camp are pretty manly ladies if I may say so. I include myself in this camp - you can smell my pits and find out. You're not the kitten-keeping-call-your-girlfriends-and-catch-up-on-the-latest-drama-box-wine type. 

You're dedicated to your craft. 

You know beyond doubt the only way you're going to get ahead in life is by learning more than you already know.

See. Right then? I just gave you the secret.

And the men. You know what? When you email, you have specific questions about technical things you want to achieve in the digital space. I love these types of emails.

So we have these two camps. The art-school drama-obsessed women of the social web, and the technically skilled men and women of the open Internet.

I'm at a fork. Do I continue to cater to the women out there? Do I keep writing more tidbits about my life, or do I go 100% into the deep end with writing about dev work?

Who am I going to keep on the list, and who'm I going to fire?

I'm letting the money speak. The camp with the most cash gets the most votes.

I'm pulling up my sales from April and May. I'm looking at my list of sales here on Fetchapp. And...scans sales...you know what I see?

The men and women with the technical skills have won.

Why? Because they're the highest earners. The men are bringing home the most and juiciest bacon.

So here's what I've decided to do. 

I let my literary agent go yesterday. The last artschool drama you'll ever read from me has been packaged up into Presence. 

It's a little document sent to me by the faeries to teach your tender hearts tech. You like to save money, so you're going to buy it before the price goes up to $125. Once the price goes up, there it will sit, and wait. And if you want to hear more personal narrative, you will buy it.

Me? I'm pivoting 100% into the development world. 

If you don't know what I mean when I say I'm Committed to Git. If your only presence on the web is your F-book account, I hope you lock yourself in. Stay there. I cannot help you.

You vote with your money and in exchange I care about those of you who have put down credit cards. The money has voted, and we have our decision.

It's technical writing and web development here on out.

Do you have the ability to sit still and concentrate long enough to learn some hard shit? If not, get out of my inbox. You're fired. I don't want to hear from you until you're ready to commit. 

To the work. 

The work is now Git, Node.js, JavaScript, the terminal and the inner workings of that machine you're parked at day in, day out.

Jealousy? Hate? I just gave you another dozen reasons for both.

And here's the _final_ final thought. I don't wear platforms anymore. I don't have to be cute. 

I wear Chucks. So now motherfuckers, I don't strut. 

_I run._

###On Open Source: I Don't Exist Without You

You send messages. You ask: _How do I start programming? How do I become a web developer? How can I do what you do?_ 

You say: It's obvious from your Gittips [you're making some money](https://www.gittip.com/gwenbell/). It seems like it'll be good for me. But. How do I start?

The answer is you already have. Reading this, you're looking at words powered by code I write. You're standing, right now, in an open source house called [Bitters](http://bitters.gwenbell.com).

Open source means it's collaborative code. This site is built on Express, which [TJ Holowaychuk](http://tjholowaychuk.com/) first put into the world. And it's powered by Node.js, which Ryan Dhal (currently on sabbatical from what I can tell) first put into the world.

<h4>Mashups: We've seen this before, and yet.</h4>

A decade ago photographers started going this route with the creative commons licenses. These licenses say (depending on the license level) take this photograph and do what you will with it.

It resulted in an uptick in creativity and sharing in the photography world.

Open source has been around for years, but I just started getting into it in the last two. I like remixing code. I enjoy cloning down repos to peek at what's going on under the hood. I get to see the inner workings of some of the minds with which I'm most fascinated and aligned.

According to my [open source report card](http://osrc.dfm.io/gwenbell), those minds include [Substack](https://github.com/substack), [TJ Holowaychuk](https://github.com/visionmedia) and [Ev Bogue](http://evbogue.com).

We see this in this kind of collaboration in the rap community. A few years ago I got into this guy Girl Talk. He's still around. He mashes up songs to make something entirely new. Still, the core from each song he samples is in there. 

He wouldn't exist without the performers who came before him. He doesn't exist without his predecessors. 

We don't exist without each other. In no place is this more obvious than open source.

<h4>It's too hard.</h4>

Those of you many years into your yoga practice, do you remember your first day on the mat? I remember my first yoga class. I didn't even have a mat. It was hilarious. Hilarious because I had no idea what was going on, nor why I would continue to do it. Let alone how it would impact my life or the lives of those around me.

_It's too hard_ is an easy way to let yourself off the hook. And I'm not trying to get you on the hook, though if you're reading this there's probably a niggling feeling in you: she's right. I gotta go deeper. 

I've become a stronger writer because I've coupled it with programming. I've become a stronger web citizen because I started programming. And I know [I'm not the only one](http://madeleineforbes.co.uk/madeleineforbes.co.uk/code.html).

<h4>How to start</h4>

As with yoga, you just start. It helps to have a good teacher. If that's not possible, it helps to have good books. I've learned everything from a book first - that's just how I learn.

I find it easier to learn the basics from a book and then go to the web to deepen. When I started learning HTML and CSS in 2004, I opened a Visual Quickstart guide. 

It had lay-flat binding, which helped.

Though I was already a yoga practitioner, I didn't eat well during the time I was under getting the basics down. I let myself eat junk food and skip showers.

As of May 2013, I recommend Ev's book, [Design Your Website](http://design.evbogue.com/). (Disclosure: I'm the proof-reading editor.) Once you've gotten the basics, you can start cloning down repos. Peer into them. I wrote about how to do this in [Git Commit](http://git.gwenbell.com).

<h4>Why bother?</h4>

I'll tell you why I bother. I want to contribute to the web by creating _for_ it, not just _sucking from it_. I give back. Creating [Bitters](http://bitters.gwenbell.com) was a first step in contributing as a programmer. 

How'd I go about that? I built the container I wanted for my work. It's a simple as possible Node.js website. It's the site you're looking at right now.

I get joy when I run across sites using an instance of Bitters. Like last night when I found [Demis Flanagan's](http://www.demisflanagan.linkpc.net/). Demis didn't ping me to let me know he'd cloned down and created a Bitters site, I just stumbled across it.

It was that moment, it was just. Yeah, Demis!

To know I might have shaved some hours off the time it would have taken him to get a Node site up. To know I might have contributed in some small way to his work, to his life. That is why I bother.

How do we become more self-reliant citizens of the web? By committing. By contributing. 

We become self-reliant citizens of the web one line of code at a time.

###Ditch Google for Good

Brooklyn, New York <br />
17 May 2013 <br />
Sound of bath running <br />

If you never hit delete, you never know what you have. To find out what you have, delete.

If you want to know how dependent you are on something, get locked out of it. It happened as I sipped on a coconut in Mexico. I got locked out of my Google account - [video about that here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlLIp-Pltiw&feature=youtu.be) - and realized my digital life was a wobbly, one-legged Google stool. 

That was December 2011. By December 2012 I'd deleted my Google account. This is how I got off and have been able to stay off, Google products. All but one - see point 7.

Ditching things requires you make a decision. A series of decisions, starting with processing your inbox.

**1** Process your inbox. Even with all the systems we've created to streamline our inboxes, we still fail to process them completely. To process it one final time, I went through my entire GMail box and made a decision about every message, stretching back to 2007.

Then I
<ol>
  <li>moved any sensitive messages to a hard drive</li>
  <li>had conversations with any people I needed to if there were things unresolved</li>
  <li>responded, no matter how old the message was, and did not apologize for doing so</li>
</ol>

I was already using gwen at gwenbell.com. I was redirecting it to Google. I simply killed the redirect and now use Thunderbird full-time.

**2** After processing to actual zero, I took some time away from it. Just because it's now at actual zero doesn't mean you're ready to delete. I took three months to delete my GMail account once I'd completely processed it.

**3** I got out of my [filter bubble](http://dontbubble.us) by switching my searches to Duck Duck Go. I now say, "hold on, let me duck duck go that".

**4** I removed myself from the Google cloud by migrating anything on Google Drive to my own external hard drive. Then I created a duplicate of that hard drive, so if I lose or damage one, I have a copy.

**5** When I need to co-write something, I use Git rather than a cloud-based service like Google Docs. You can also try [Prose.io](http://prose.io/).

**6** Communication. Lots of you have asked about getting off Google Chat. There's [XMPP](http://xmpp.org/) for that.

**7** The only thing I use Google for at this point is the Youtube live broadcast and record simultaneously feature. When Jitsi adds that, or WebRTC gets it, I'll switch.

**8** Browser! I now use [Firefox, Nightly Build](http://nightly.mozilla.org/).

**9** This is the hardest of all. When you leave the ecosystem, leave completely. Avoid sites that talk about Google at length, and stay away from sources you once enjoyed that are Google-centric. The investment to do so is time, and paying closer attention.

If you never hit delete, you never know what you have. What's left after you hit delete? Just sit there and wonder.

Our work becomes more resilient through deletion.

<hr />

If you get something from this work, consider [giving to it](http://gittip.com/gwenbell). If you already support the work, thank you.

<p class="lead">What if you could let the part of your brain with EARN stamped on it rest for a while? Or forever?</p>

I watched Synecdoche, New York yesterday. Then I walked from Brooklyn to Manhattan, New York as the sun set. I walked a total of 16,557 steps, which according to my iPod Nano watch was 7.83 miles. I saw four condoms in various states of used. I saw two people sleeping on the street. I saw one woman with platinum hair run from one end to the other and back in the time it took me to get to the end of the Williamsburg bridge.

Ev suggested Synecdoche because he knows my love for intense programming. 

My two favorite shows of all time are Six Feet Under, which I watched in its entirety as I learned to program last year. And The Wire, which I almost gave up on because I was bored stiff during the first episode. I stayed with it only because Madeleine Forbes and Ev were all, "give it a chance, man," and now I love it.

The other reason Ev suggested Synecdoche is since the start of the week I've given a lot of thought to genius grants. These things actually exist. They're called MacArthur Fellowships. It's all anonymous, which is also true for [Gittip](http://gittip.com), which I view as distributed, peer-to-peer genius grants. Lots of people supporting each other financially so they can work on and do what they love. Those who have more to give, contribute more. Those who are doing the work and need more support, get more.

In Synecdoche, the main character, Caden Cotard (played by Philip Seymour Hoffman) is given one such genius grant (though in his case it's a lump-sum from higher up, rather than little bits from lots of people - his is vertical, rather than horizontal) about a quarter of the way through the film. He goes from getting by to having so much income he can do whatever he wants with his time and never thinks about earning again. 

He lets the part of his brain stamped EARN take a permanent vacation.

Sounds great! But when you think about it, especially if you've watched The Wire, you know what I mean when I say The Hustle gives you Purpose. It does. The drive to get some product out the door gives you laser-like focus, and without the boundaries of 'you're running out of cashmoney', you've got to get that pushback from _somewhere_.

Caden Cotard is tragic - not semi-tragic, not kinda pathetic melancholy in an Eternal Sunshine kinda way. No, I find him flat-out tragic. This play he's making, funded by the genius grant, goes on for most of eternity, and I don't want to spoil the plot, but there's really no saving graces to this guy. I keep wanting for there to be. But with unlimited funding, it's like he has a permanent case of The Resistance.

If you read my work during 2011 and 2012, you know I got obsessed with The Resistance. After I read _The War of Art_ I started seeing The Resistance everywhere, in everybody, including myself. I couldn't not see it. I was grateful Steven Pressfield had written, finally, the truth about getting things into the world. He covered, in a slim volume, basically every kind of cop out, every excuse I had for not doing the work. Once I got to the end I was all, 'huh. I've done every single one of these things. Now that I know about the Resistance, I'll aim to never have it again!' 

That has almost but not quite worked out. 

Anyway, Caden has The Resistance (which, by the way, is contagious), but there's something more pernicious at play. He spends the duration of the film trying to get buy-in. From anybody. His wife, his second wife, his daughter, the people in the play he's staging. He wants them to say you're an alright kinda guy Caden. You're doing your best. And even when they _do_ say that, he never takes it to heart. He keeps berating himself, wishing he could get _total buy-in_ from _the whole world_. Failing that, he keeps plugging on this play, trying to get _it_ perfect. (Trying to get it perfect is a symptom of the Resistance. You have to hit publish, even if you think it's shit, which you always a little bit will. Think it's shit, that is.)

The only person who can give you total buy-in on your life is you.

There's also no pleasure to this guy's life. He's so caught up in his own _dukkha_ which means dissatisfaction in Buddhist, that he can't see straight. Sure, he fucks but it's always sad. You know, like he's hoping he could perform a little better. He's weepy and self-absorbed. (Contrast that with self-contained.) 

He never merges with his lover. He holds her at arm's length, wanting, you guessed it. 

Total buy-in.

The only person who will give you total buy-in is you. That's why when someone says to me, 'Oh, I could never write like you do. My life's not that interesting,' I take them at their word. 

I see they haven't bought into their own story.

This isn't to say you don't have to drop the story-_line_. My work isn't just in telling masturbatory stories I like to write that you'll like to read. It's also unplugging for two years to listen to my own voice. To discover whether what I'm telling you is true is true for me, or is it just what you (they, the group/collective) want to hear.

Returning after two years away, I'm clearer now on my voice than I was when I left. And. It turns out, the voice isn't that much different. That's one thing I've enjoyed about being back on Twitter this week. Oh! Here I am. And I'm not a whole lot different than when I blank-slated.

Which. Is why I blank the slate. What remains after you blank the slate is as close to true as you're going to get. And you're never going to get to total blank. 

You will never come out clean.

That is what I love about Six Feet Under. None of those characters come out clean, and still, I forgive each one. I forgive them their foibles and 'shortcomings'. 

I forgive the parts of them I thought I couldn't forgive in myself.

They remind me I can let myself off the hook. Caden never lets himself off the hook. He never builds his pleasure palette. He never takes stock of what brings him geniune pleasure.

And I wonder if that's because _he never bottoms out_. I've bottomed out so many times now. I chuckle when I think about them. I don't think my mini-tragedies are actually all that tragic. Yes, of course, hard at the time. Yes, if you're going through hell keep going. But maybe it was during these past two years during a self-chosen exile that showed me: it could always be worse. And it has made pleasure _that much easier_ to touch, each moment.

I didn't always say that. I used to say, "this is the worst thing of all time!" High drama. I'd fling myself on the couch and have a cry for the afternoon.

But when I turn anything on its head and say, "it could always be worse," and "what's the worst that could happen here?" I see the situation differently. That difference, though slim, hasn't just once saved my life. It keeps saving my life.

Whether you think mine is a life worth living means not a whit to me. 

Because the person who has to demonstrate total buy-in is me.

And I do.

###An Engineer Like You

</audio>

Last week I called my grandfather, whom I call Bub. I called Bub to remind him of when I was little and I'd beg to go with him to the hospital. Bub worked shift work his whole life, and most of the time I knew him growing up, he did the shift work in a hospital. 

We're both engineers, though he did his work AFK. He never used a computer for work, but he did have a man cave he'd go into when he got to the hospital to start his shift, and that was one of the things I liked best about it. That there was this secret place in this ginormous hospital where he, and sometimes I, could go hide out. 

The engineering break room was long and narrow with a bed in the back against the wall. There was a pinup calendar with voluptuous women in tiny outfits in front of motorcycles. The room smelled of tools, of grease and of men, since those were the only things in there most of the time.

I actually hated hospitals is the thing. I didn't want to be in the hospital itself, because it was the same place my mom spent a lot of her five years dying.

Anyway, engineering. Bub's shift. The thing is. When I called him to remind him of how I loved going into work with him, he didn't start reflecting back what I was expecting to hear. He said

_Honey, you remember when you wanted to take a shower out there after the hurricane?_

_No, what do you mean take a shower? At the hospital?_

_Mmhmm, right. I took you in there in the Renault and you remember that curve at the KOA, a tree came right in through the windshield. Whole tree branch._

_OhmygodBub. I could have died!_

_Sure right you could have. Nearly got your face, I... (he trails) You don't remember that?_

_Well, huh. Yeah, no. I guess I don't._

_Well, we turned back and got a different car. And then I got that generator so you could take showers. Yup, sure did._

<hr /> 

Sometimes I don't get out of him what I went into the call for, but I get something that jump starts another line of thinking. Which of course is ok with me. Bub's in his seventies now, which you'd think would dull him. But the opposite has happened. He remembers a whole set of data that I have altogether forgotten. He has an engineering mind, he sees systems I don't.

Looking at the hospital as an engineer isn't the same as being a patient there. I didn't feel scared when I hung with Bub. Even when very little, when I felt lonely or sad or tired I'd grab a hand, and his hands were usually a little greasy, and always warm. And I knew I could trust him as we navigated the labyrinthine hospital up to the roof. Where we'd check in on the fans. And then down to the generator room, which was still running during the hurricane, hence the shower I was able to take.

The generators can't go down at a hospital. That's the mission critical room. Generators make it so any terrible thing can happen and those patients on respirators, those patients who are in compromised situations, they still get the support they need.

<hr />

As I've become an engineer myself, I experience the joy and challenge of being relied upon. Not relied upon as in if this goes down, people will die. I'm not that kind of engineer. But when I see an ECONNREFUSED I know there are people on the other side of their machines getting something other than they expect. I go into the generator room that is my virtual private server, and I start -ef'ing around, killing and restarting processes.

And, I go into diagnosis mode. If I can't right the ship immediately, I step away from the machine and reapproach again, once I've thought about it.

Becoming an engineer has slowed me down. I think in a different way now. 

I like to imagine I think more like Bub.

<hr />

Before we hung up the call I said

_Hey Bub, listen. I don't think I've ever really told you this, but I respect the work you've done. Thank you for showing me how I could become an engineer like you._

_Mmhmm, well, alright honey. Call your grandmother, she's over at Et's._

<h1>Writing on Death</h1>

<a name="tuesday"></a>
###Tuesday. To the Letter.

I'm coming into the final stretch for _Terminal_. 

I remember hearing the phrase, I didn't write that, it wrote me. And I remember thinking, every time I heard that, yeah fucking right you didn't write it. If you didn't write it, who wrote it? Because someone had to show up to the page.

Now, I get it. I mean, I _get_ it because I _got_ this one. I got _Terminal_ from the astral plane. I think that sounds weird as fuck. I think it sounds like I was possessed or something. And I guess in a way I have been.

It started with a visit from my mom. She visits about once every decade, but she's visited twice in the time I've been in the city. I watched Ghostbusters right before I moved here. And it sounds absurd to me, but I feel the spirits in the crypts as I walk past on my way to the Japaneast Village. 

I went in there once, and there were dimes and nickels, and pennies, all over those headstones. And many of the headstones were wiped nearly clean, their names and dates of deaths and epitephs...wiped away by the thousands of feet that have walked in and out of that crypt through the years. 

Who is next? This morning I went into the closet, literally, because it's cold in the house right now and I wanted warmth, so I went in there with the sleeping bag that operates as a duvet cover, and I went in there and the faeries, who are always there, were there.

And so was Biggie Smalls. He talked to me about privacy in an open world. He talked to me about stashes. 

It was ripe in there by the time I rolled out. I mean, me and Biggie, plus faeries in the closet? That is a lot of body.

Who is next? Mom. She is up. 

Steve Jobs. Alan Watts. The faeries who are shot all through this. Where they're from, why they arrived, what happens with them, where you can find them.

Tuesday. To the letter.

###Come Out Clean

I'm holding the certificate of my mom's death. It's rusty paper clipped together with the paperwork terminating my father's parental rights.

I didn't know my mom's social security number until I found this piece of paper. I don't think I ever even saw this until last night. I was going through paperwork, hand shredding old documents like the paperwork from the Red Cross, when they came after the house burned down. I've saved trauma paperwork I guess. Having it around helped me remember it was real.

Mom died November 30, 1992. My father's parental rights were terminated on the 7th of February 1994 due to item 10: the Defendant has not provided any support for the minor child since her birth. 

Looking at the time between those two dates, I might as well have lived twenty three lives.

Though the termination of his parental rights is final, the certificate of death is deeply final. It's even a slimmer volume than the termination of parental rights - that's three pages. Mom's death certificate is just one. At the bottom, someone named Gailia signed off on it. I guess Gailia had gotten a pay bump because she hand-scratched out Assistant so that just Deputy shows.

While I lived in my grandparent's basement teaching myself how to program I watched every episode of Six Feet Under. It was a treat when I was done coding for the day.

I'd tried to watch it years prior, but couldn't handle the intensity. The opening scenes, at the time I found simultaneously overwhelming and undertasteful. The sex scene in the airport closet? I was all, "who would actually do that?" And, that, I found out, was the point Alan Ball was making.

It was Six Feet Under that prompted my decision to move to New York City. I didn't have to travel anymore. Some things got cleared up in me. 

I saw humanity as sort of a giant human cake in the oven. Once in a while you open the oven door, you go in with a knife. You stick it in to check how it's doing, is it cooked all the way through? Every single time you pull out the knife, it doesn't come out clean. The cake never cooks all the way through.

I saw that in myself. I was able to see that there's no amount of striving, no amount of travel, no amount of work, no amount of doing that will make me stick the knife in and have it come out clean.

There is no clean.

I called Bub. 

Bub, I found mom's death certificate.

Well, honey, I wasn't aware it'd gone missing.

No, that's not what I mean. I mean I was going through some papers and it was in there somehow. I'd never seen it.

Mmhmm, well alright.

Well, I just learned her social security number.

Well, honey, I don't even think _I_ know her social security number.

<hr />

I called Nunu.

We were out in the woods stripping out fish entrails.

That's hardcore. So listen, I just found mom's death certificate. Don't you reckon they have to recycle social security numbers? I just saw hers for the first time.

I suppose they do, don't they? I heard that one time, that they reuse them once the deceased has been gone twenty years.

Nunu, it's been that long now.

I know that is true.

<hr />

The cause of death is asked. There are all sorts of other questions, but under 'Due to or as a consequence of' there's Hodgkins Disease, which they don't know but I do, started as a lump in her neck. And next to that, approximate interval between onset and death: 5 years.

There is no question about how much money was in her bank account. There is no question about how much cash was in her wallet. There is no question about was her inbox at zero. There is no question about was there just this one last thing she wanted to get done real quick before we print this sucker out?

In death, we become one piece of paper, a single entry in the register of deeds. 

Our final selves, booked.
