### What is presence?

Presence is a distillation of the best I've offered the past three years. It includes as a bonus my most recent work, Terminal.

### Terminal

#### Gwen Bell | June 2013

Terminal is a technology book dedicated to making the hidden visible. As I became a programmer, I realized much of the mystique around being a programmer happens on the command line. I wrote Terminal to demystify things. For a programmer, the terminal is how you access the guts of your machine; this is an access point to those guts.

Terminal offers the why of computing as you read the how of [Git Commit](http://git.gwenbell.com). I cover thirty days on the command line in Git Commit, and before you even approach the terminal, you have to have some idea why the terminal exists and why it matters. Get that in Terminal.

Terminal is a collection of interviews to guide you onto the command line and into the world of programming.

### Reverb

#### Gwen Bell | March 2012

It’s a reverberation when the desire to see it chart its own path becomes greater than the urge to control it. (I think that’s also a definition of love.)

Reverb started as #best09 in 2009 and became #reverb10 in 2010. From hundreds of participants in the first year, to thousands in year two, the project reverberated through the web. It generated over 1,000 pages of tweets in just one month. Reverb's the story of how that, and other successful reverberations, happened.

### Attention Detox

#### Gwen Bell | Jan 2012

An Attention Detox helps you keep track of your attention for 168 hours. It's guaranteed to bring into focus how distracted you are, and what you need to do reclaim your attention.

The original version included a guided version - I watched, shared observations and guided participants. The attention detox included with Presence is self-guided.

### Digital Warriorship

#### Gwen Bell | Feb 2011

To be present for others, first see and hear yourself. 

Align your real self with your digital self. My path from scrolling for empathy to taking digital sabbaticals and what I learned. Here's an introduction to start developing your presence.

I would not have become a programmer if I had not done the things that I rolled into _Presence_. This is the path I took; I've illuminated what's ahead.
