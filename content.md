+ **18 Apr** Pulled [Bitters](https://github.com/gwenbell/gwenbell.com/pulse) down from Gitboria where it was hidden behind CJDNS. You can now view source. Pull request, anyone!?

+ **17 Apr** [Idiocracy](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/idiocracy/) may be my all-time favorite movie. Honest, hilarious, foreboding, robust. Just watched it for the third time. Confirmed. Might have killed Luke Wilson's career, but it lights me up.

+ **16 Apr** Discovered a new Japanese ramen ya, followed by work, followed by a conversation about SHA with M. This day could only get better with yoga. And that's next.

+ **16 Apr** [Shit](http://blog.linode.com/2013/04/16/security-incident-update/).

+ **15 Apr** Baked chocolate chip cookies, commited about 100 site changes, and added two new chapters to [Git for Publishers](http://git.gwenbell.com). Solid night in with candles lit and simply rain in the background.

+ **14 Apr** New [About](http://gwenbell.com/about). Hooray. Next, to yoga to decompress. Intense weekend on the machine!
